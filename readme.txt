== Description ==

An overview of the features is below.
- Operate the slider plugins VEGAS2 and SWIPER using the block interface and provide blocks to display on the website.
- Two blocks are bundled: `Fade MainView` which operates and displays VEGAS2 settings and `Slide MainView` which operates and displays SWIPER settings.
- `Fade MainView` selects multiple images from the WordPress media library and displays them one by one. At that time, settings can be made by operating blocks to produce a variety of VEGAS2 effects.
- `Slide MainView` is set to `Design Grorp` of [BLOCK COLLECTIONS plugin](https://ja.wordpress.org/plugins/block-collections/) as the SWIPER slide. Therefore, not only images, but also content such as text and tables can be displayed as SWIPER slides with a variety of effects.

== Arbitrary section ==
1. Style settings that may require responsive support can be set separately for desktop mode (displayed on devices with a width of 768px or more) and mobile mode (displayed on devices with a width of 767px or less). To tell which setting is set, when you switch the display mode in the block editor or site editor, "(Desktop)" and "(Mobile)" will be displayed in the side menu display.
Please note that responsiveness for tablet display is not supported.
2. This plugin depends on the [BLOCK COLLECTIONS plugin](https://ja.wordpress.org/plugins/block-collections/). This plugin requires installation and activation in order to use it.
